# ðŸ“š Books Dataset EDA

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes a dataset of books, including details like genre, publishing year, language, ratings, sales, and publishers.  
The goal is to clean the data, visualize distributions, and uncover insights into publishing trends, reader preferences, and market performance.

## Features of the Project
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns.
  - Standardized column names.
  - Fixed inconsistent categories (e.g., languages, publishers).
  - Handled missing values.
- **Exploratory Analysis**:
  - Genre and language distribution.
  - Trends in publishing years.
  - Author and publisher performance.
  - Ratings and sales comparisons.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and boxplots.
  - Distribution plots for categorical and numerical features.
  - Comparisons of ratings across genres and languages.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Fiction dominates the dataset, but non-fiction genres have higher variance in ratings.
- English-language books make up the majority, though other languages are also represented.
- Some publishers (e.g., HarperCollins) dominate both book count and sales.
- Ratings do not always correlate with sales â€” suggesting marketing and publisher influence.
