# ðŸŽ¢ Roller Coaster EDA

## Overview
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a roller coaster dataset.  
The goal is to clean, explore, and visualize trends in roller coaster characteristics such as speed, height, inversions, and G-force, as well as relationships between these features.

## Features of the Project
- **Data Cleaning**: Renamed columns, handled duplicates, and formatted dates.
- **Feature Exploration**: Distribution plots for speed, height, inversions, and more.
- **Feature Relationships**: Scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Insights**: Identified locations with the fastest coasters (minimum 10 per location).

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Most roller coasters were introduced in certain peak years.
- Speed and height show a positive correlation.
- Some locations have significantly higher average coaster speeds.
